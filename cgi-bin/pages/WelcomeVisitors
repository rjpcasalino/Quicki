!! Abandon all hope, ye who enter here!

This is just a toy wiki and isn't secure in any real sense of that word. Nothing is, sadly. In any case...

Hey everyone, it's 2000 and we're gonna party as such!
Thanks and enjoy!

It's relatively easy to make new pages and contribute!
!! Using wiki's old markup style:
# [!!] is an h2
# [!!!] an h3
# ['\'2x single quotes means emphasize'\']. The backslash is an EscapeSequence.
** ''now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country.''
# ['\'\'3x means strong'\'\']
** '''getting it?'''
# just use CamelCase to get to other pages within the wiki
## external links are funny because 25 years ago there was no HypertextTransferProtocolSecure (HTTPS), thus any URL with an `https` prefix will fail to be parsed as a valid link. I'll fix this later. Just use http (as most pages will reroute to the secure equivalent. Example:
** http://www.boringtranquility.io/ 
** I just fixed this by feeding `https` into the regex - RyanCasalino (4/15/20)

Remember to follow CamelCase convention!
